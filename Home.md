# User Guide

Bazel Buildfarm is a service software stack which presents an implementation of the [Remote Execution API](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis). This means it can be used by any client of that API to retain content ([[ContentAddressableStorage]]), cache ActionResults by a key ([[ActionCache]]), and execute actions asynchronously ([[Execution]]).

This documentation is intended as a comprehensive and ongoing description of its architecture, features, functionality, and operation, as well as a guide to a smoothly running install of the software. Familiarity with the Remote Execution API is expected, and references will be provided to it as needed.
